I am an Assistant Professor at the Institute of Artificial Intelligence Innovation at Yang Ming University. My research primarily centers on Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision, with a particular emphasis on how these fields amplify human creativity. I delve into various aspects, including Generative Models, 3D Representations, and the dynamics of Large Multimodal Models, all aiming to advance our understanding of how AI can augment and enhance human creative endeavors.

Prior to my current role, I had the opportunity to serve as a data scientist and lead a team at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. During my tenure there, I collaborated closely with Foundry Engineers, assisting them in navigating intricate data analytics challenges. My work involved extensive research and analysis across various domains, including defect inspection and yield prediction, employing cutting-edge deep learning techniques.

Furthermore, I've been deeply passionate about exploring the intersection of AI and artistic creativity. My efforts have been dedicated to understanding and unlocking the potential for expansion in artistic realms through collaboration between AI technologies and human experts.

At present, I am actively seeking enthusiastic and driven graduate and doctoral students who share a similar interest in delving into this fascinating research domain. If you're someone passionate about exploring the synergy between AI and creativity, I warmly welcome you to connect with me.
