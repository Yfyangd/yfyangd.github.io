My research primarily focuses on Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision, with a strong emphasis on enhancing human creativity and intelligent manufacturing. I explore various domains, including Generative Models, 3D Representations, Quantum Deep Learning, and Large Multimodal Models, to advance AIâ€™s role in augmenting human ingenuity and industrial innovation.  

Before transitioning to academia, I served as a Data Scientist and Team Lead at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), where I worked closely with Foundry Engineers to tackle complex data analytics challenges. My research spanned multiple domains, including defect inspection and yield prediction, leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to enhance semiconductor manufacturing processes.  

### Key Contributions in Robotic AI and Automation 
I spearheaded AI-driven automation initiatives in semiconductor manufacturing, focusing on:  
- Leading a specialized team in Robotic AI and Automation to optimize production workflows.  
- Developing and deploying AI-powered robotic systems to enhance efficiency and precision.  
- Pioneering automation strategies that reduced operational costs and improved throughput.  
- Integrating cutting-edge automation technologies across cross-functional teams and manufacturing facilities.  
- Advancing deep learning defect inspection techniques, including defect detection, classification, segmentation, and root cause analysis (RCA) to enhance accuracy and reliability.  
- Mentoring engineers in AI and automation, fostering a culture of innovation and technical excellence.  

### Current Research Interests  
1. Computer Vision  
   - Developing 2D and 3D foundation models for object detection, segmentation, and 3D reconstruction.  
2. Generative AI  
   - Exploring generative models for process optimization, anomaly detection, and the development of Generative Digital Twins for simulation and system modeling.  
3. Robotic AI  
   - Researching RL, VLA, VLN and Real2Sim/Sim2Real methodologies for intelligent robotic systems.
