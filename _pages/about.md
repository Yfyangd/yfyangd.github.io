My research primarily centers on Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision, with a particular emphasis on how these fields amplify human creativity and intelligence manufacturing. I delve into various aspects, including Generative Models, 3D Representations, Quantum Deep Learning, and the dynamics of Large Multimodal Models, all aiming to advance our understanding of how AI can augment and enhance human creative endeavors.

Prior to my current role, I had the opportunity to serve as a data scientist and lead a team at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. During my tenure there, I collaborated closely with Foundry Engineers, assisting them in navigating intricate data analytics challenges. My work involved extensive research and analysis across various domains, including defect inspection and yield prediction, employing cutting-edge deep learning techniques.

Furthermore, I've been deeply passionate about exploring the intersection of AI and artistic creativity. My efforts have been dedicated to understanding and unlocking the potential for expansion in artistic realms through collaboration between AI technologies and human experts.

At the moment, I'm actively seeking passionate and motivated graduate and doctoral students who share a keen interest in exploring this captivating research domain. If you're enthusiastic about investigating the intersection of AI and creativity, I wholeheartedly encourage you to reach out to me directly or utilize the personalized assistant available as a **chatbot** in the bottom right corner.
