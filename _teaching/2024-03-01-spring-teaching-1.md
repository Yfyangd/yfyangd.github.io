## Course Overview and Objectives:
This course aims to provide students with a deep understanding of the fundamental concepts and techniques of computer vision, including image formation, feature extraction, 3D reconstruction, image segmentation, object recognition, deep learning, object detection, object tracking, and facial recognition. It also aims to equip students with the implementation and application of algorithms, models, and frameworks related to computer vision, enabling them to address computer vision problems across various domains such as autonomous driving, smart homes, medical image analysis, and more. Through this course, students will comprehend the limitations and challenges of current computer vision applications and explore future development directions. By undertaking this course, students will acquire the following abilities:
* Fundamental knowledge and skills in computer vision and image processing.
* Sensitivity and analytical skills toward emerging technologies and trends.
* Capability to conduct independent research and development, possessing teamwork and project management abilities.
* Innovative thinking and problem-solving skills, with the capacity to apply learned knowledge to promote technological innovation and societal progress.

## The assessment for this course
* Assignments (30%): Including programming tasks, literature review reports, etc.
* Midterm Report (30%): Students are required to choose a computer vision-related paper published within the last 3 years and compose a research report. Additional credit will be given if it includes a demo and technical implementation.
* Final Project (40%): Students must select a computer vision-related topic and prepare a research report along with an implemented project. Evaluation criteria include a clear understanding of the problem, innovativeness, practicality of the solution, completeness, and efficiency of the technical implementation.
