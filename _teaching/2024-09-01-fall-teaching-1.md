## Course Overview and Objectives:
This course, Artificial Intelligence (IIAI30017), offers students a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental concepts, techniques, and applications of artificial intelligence (AI). Through lectures, programming assignments, literature reviews, and project-based learning, students will gain both theoretical understanding and practical skills in AI. 
* Acquire foundational knowledge and technical skills in generative AI and image synthesis.
* Demonstrate sensitivity to emerging technologies and the ability to critically analyze new trends.
* Conduct independent research and development projects, while also contributing effectively to team collaboration and project management.
* Apply innovative thinking and problem-solving skills to advance technological innovation and create broader societal impact.

## Prerequisites
* Programming Proficiency in Python
  * All assignments will be implemented in Python. Students with extensive programming experience in other languages (e.g., C++, Matlab, or JavaScript) should still be able to adapt.
* Mathematics Foundations
  * Calculus and Linear Algebra: Ability to take derivatives, and familiarity with matrix–vector operations and notation.
  * Probability and Statistics: Understanding of basic probability concepts, Gaussian distributions, mean, standard deviation, and related statistical measures.
* Deep Learning/Machine Learning
 
## Grading
* Assignments (20%): Including programming assignments, literature review reports, etc.
* Midterm Report (30%): Students need to select a GenAI-related paper from the past three years and write a research report. The report should include Background, Motivation, Proposed Method, Result, and Personal Reflection. Additional points will be awarded for including a demo and technical implementation in the report.
* Final Project (40%): Including project presentation, and final project report. Students are required to select a GenAI-related topic, develop a proposal, and undertake an implementation project. The evaluation criteria encompass a thorough comprehension of the problem, innovation, practicality of the solution, completeness, and performance of the technical implementation. Additional credit will be awarded for incorporating a demo and technical implementation.
* Class Participation (10%): Class Participation.
* For each absence during roll call:-1 for the final grade.

## Office Hours
* Monday 11:00-12:00 am
* Room: Engineering Building-6 (374)
