## Course Overview and Objectives:
This course, Artificial Intelligence (IIAI30017), offers students a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental concepts, techniques, and applications of artificial intelligence (AI). Through lectures, programming assignments, literature reviews, and project-based learning, students will gain both theoretical understanding and practical skills in AI. 

* Provide a strong foundation in core AI principles, including search, knowledge representation, reasoning, probability, and machine learning.
* Develop proficiency in Python programming for AI applications, reinforcing concepts through practical assignments.
* Enhance students’ ability to critically read, evaluate, and present recent AI research papers.
* Cultivate problem-solving skills through a midterm report and a final project, encouraging creativity, innovation, and technical rigor.
* Equip students with hands-on experience in developing AI solutions that bridge theory and practice, with additional focus on demos and implementations.
* Encourage teamwork, communication, and class participation, preparing students to engage in both academic and industrial AI contexts.

## Prerequisites
* Programming Proficiency in Python
  * All assignments will be implemented in Python. Students with extensive programming experience in other languages (e.g., C++, Matlab, or JavaScript) should still be able to adapt.
* Mathematics Foundations
  * Calculus and Linear Algebra: Ability to take derivatives, and familiarity with matrix–vector operations and notation.
  * Probability and Statistics: Understanding of basic probability concepts, Gaussian distributions, mean, standard deviation, and related statistical measures.

## Grading
* Assignments (30%): Including programming assignments, literature review reports, etc.
* Midterm Report (20%): Students need to select a AI-related paper from the past three years and write a research report. The report should include Background, Motivation, Proposed Method, Result, and Personal Reflection. Additional points will be awarded for including a demo and technical implementation in the report.
* Final Project (40%): Including project presentation, and final project report. Students are required to select a AI-related topic, develop a proposal, and undertake an implementation project. The evaluation criteria encompass a thorough comprehension of the problem, innovation, practicality of the solution, completeness, and performance of the technical implementation. Additional credit will be awarded for incorporating a demo and technical implementation.
* Class Participation (10%): Class Participation.
* For each absence during roll call:-1 for the final grade.
