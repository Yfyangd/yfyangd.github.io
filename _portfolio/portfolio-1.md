<a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US20150064814">the patent</a> is about an assembly of the ion implanter system. The assembly includes a control unit, a wafer holder and a detecting device. The wafer holder and the detecting device are respectiviely positioned at two sides of the control unit. The control unit is configured to drive the wafer holder and the detecting device to rotate about at least one rotation axis. There is no need to move a detecting device outside of a process chamber into the proces chamber for ion beam tuning. Therefore, operation time is greatly reduced, and the implantation quality is improved.
